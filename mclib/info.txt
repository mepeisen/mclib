This project contains a patched copy of snakeyml.
snakeyaml comes with Apache license. See snakeyml.LICENSE.txt
The patch was contributed to original repos via pull request.

To get access to this patches version we need to provide it
with our own package name. Spigot has it's own yml version
shipped with spigot jar. We won't be able to access our own
patchesd version using the default classpath.
